  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I've been a Macintosh developer since 1986. I love to write code, and I strive to keep learning how to write better code.</p>
  <p>This is my personal professional blog. The articles I post here are my own thoughts, work, and opinions, and do not reflect the views, nor am I a spokesman for, any employer, past or present.</p>
