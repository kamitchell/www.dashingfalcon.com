GIFConverter is a graphics viewing and converting program for the
Macintosh. It can display the following graphic types, and convert
between them:

-   GIF
-   JPEG (and progressive JPEG in GIFConverter 2.4)
-   PICT
-   MacPaint
-   CompuServe RLE
-   TIFF
-   RIFF
-   EPS (output only)
-   PNG (in GIFConverter 2.4)

GIFConverter 2.4 also introduces many new Features, including
progressive JPEG, PNG, scriptability, and recordability.

Here are some of the features in GIFConverter 2.4:

-   GIFConverter is now **native** on the PowerPC. It’s delivered as a
    fat application.
-   GIFConverter now supports **progressive JPEG**. Also, problems with
    JPEG comments have been fixed.
-   GIFConverter now has initial support for **PNG**. Missing are
    comments, transparency and gamma support. They’re coming.
-   GIFConverter supports more **GIF features**:
    -   GIFConverter has always had support for **multiple images**.
    -   Direct support for **transparency**.
    -   **Animation support**: Delay, disposal method, user input, and
        loop count.

-   Change the **size** and **position** of images with dialog boxes.
-   Direct **preview** in your **HTML browser**. There’s room for
    interpretation in the GIF animation specification, and differences
    in color rendering.
-   Apply the **Netscape color palette** to your images.
-   GIFConverter is now **AppleScript scriptable and recordable**. Some
    of the older commands aren’t scriptable yet. There’s plenty there to
    work with. Set many **properties** on the document and the its
    contained images. You can do things like write a droplet that will
    set the transparency to the color of the top left pixel, for
    instance.
-   And, there are sample **batch-conversion scripts**. Wish
    GIFConverter converted things *your* way? Just change the scripts
    yourself!
-   You’ll be asked about **file preferences** on every save. No more
    hidden surprises. And you can specify them on the save AppleScript
    command. Write scripts to interlace all your GIF files!
-   GIFConverter has **better memory management**. It will use unused
    memory automatically.
-   Many **bugs have been fixed**. GIFConverter’s internals have had a
    major overhaul, which should reduce or eliminate the number of
    crashes users have experienced.
