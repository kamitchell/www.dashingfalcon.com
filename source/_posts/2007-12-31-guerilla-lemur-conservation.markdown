Mike Lee over at Delicious Monster has come up with an idea that I
heartily approve of. A campaign to raise donations for the [Madagascar Fauna Group][].

Viral internet conservation combined with interesting ways for
independent software developers to make a difference.

Itâ€™s a great way to help improve the world we live in. Join [Club Thievey][]. I did.
