Talking with [Wolf Rentzsch][] after the [CAWUG][] meeting today, I
mused about the upcoming [Snow Leopard][] release, which is mostly
internal improvements relating to performance, and few user-facing
features announced so far (the chief being Exchange support).

This is really about showing Microsoft how it’s done. Windows 7 will be
Microsoft figuring out how to slim down the kernel, and reinvent Windows
into some sort of manageable form.

Meanwhile, OS X is facing its seventh release (10.0 being the first).
Instead of a huge torrent of new features, Snow Leopard takes a step
back, puts on some polish, and puts more horsepower under the hood.

This is a good move on Apple’s part. It’s an indication that the firm
foundations have been laid and built upon, the features are in place and
solid. It’s a sign of success.

It’s basically a sabbatical. The first great act of OS X creation is
complete, and Apple looked upon it, and it was good.
