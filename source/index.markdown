I’m Kevin Mitchell and I’m an independent Macintosh software developer.
I’ve been programming on Macintosh since about 1986, maybe a little
earlier.

In 1987, I started work on the program that would eventually become
[GIFConverter][]. GIFConverter was quite successful, and it was
gratifying to produce something that so many people found useful. 
But for all those years, I did business under my own name.

As I started looking at new projects to work on, I decided it was time
to have one of those cool adjective-noun names like other Mac indie
devs.

So after over 20 years of independent Macintosh software development,
the business finally has a name: Dashing Falcon. My goal: To deliver
useful and fun products for Mac and iPhone with the agility that only a
small company can have.
